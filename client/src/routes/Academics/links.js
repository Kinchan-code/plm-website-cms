Such is the legacy of the Pamantasan culture nurtured through the uprightness of human philosophies. Such is the salient reason for the existence of Pamantasan, without which, it has no leg to stand on and would be reduced into oblivion. These are the very reasons for the continuing success of Pamantasan, the wisdom behind the unprecedented success of a 'true class of Filipino education.'",
