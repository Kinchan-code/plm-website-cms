          The Board of Regents is a collegial body composed of seven (7) highly
          distinguished members, six (6) of whom are appointed by the Mayor of
          the city of Manila, with the consent of the then-Municipal Board,
          which is now the City Council of Manila. Of the six members appointed
          by the Mayor, the PLM Charter prescribes that one comes from the
          faculty, another is a distinguished alumnus, and one of the others
          from the field of education. The university regents are chosen on the
          basis of their professional competence. They are men of high and
          eminent integrity and distinguished professionals among the citizenry.
          The Division of City Schools (DCS) superintendent of Manila sits as an
          ex-officio member of the Board of Regents and becomes the 7th member
          of the Board.
